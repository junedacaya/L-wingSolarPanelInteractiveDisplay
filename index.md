### November 4th, 2019(Week 9)
Soldered my PCB today. And purchased my usb wire for the Nucleo. I will update my budget. Interms of financial status, I only added a usb wire purchase in the previous week. In terms of the timeline for the project, I am currently ontime for finishing project goals everyweek. Photos of my soldered PCB and a simple connection showing power flowing from power source to ground.
