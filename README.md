## PLC Components Build Instruction
For this build instruction, we will be assembling the Nucleo Wifi PLC using their components shown in the System Diagram which are developed and created by STMicroelectronics. There are three primary hardware components that a developer needs to build their own wireless PLC:
* A CPU/MCU
* Input/output signal conditioning/ PLC functions
* A Wi-Fi module/connection

## Bill of Material / Budget

The billing below are just the 4 major components of the PLC. Appart from the major components, you need to buy a mini-USB connector to connect the components into the PC in order for you to code the flatform. All purchase I've made were free from delivery fees because DigiKey offers free deliveries more than $100 and I also have a amazon prime where I ordered my mini-USB connector. All in all, I would suggest that you order the parts at one go so that you will be able to avail the free one day delivery offered by DigiKey. A total of $50 cad would be sufficient for the whole project.
