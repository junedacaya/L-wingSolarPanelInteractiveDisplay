## PLC Components Build Instruction
For this build instruction, we will be assembling the Nucleo Wifi PLC using their components shown in the System Diagram which are developed and created by STMicroelectronics. There are three primary hardware components that a developer needs to build their own wireless PLC:
* A CPU/MCU
* Input/output signal conditioning/ PLC functions
* A Wi-Fi module/connection
